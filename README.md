# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This is a simple Hello World program, with a twist, because one print line is boring.

I created this for the main purpose of refreshing my knowledge of adding, committing, pushing, and pulling on Git and Github.

# Development Environment

I prefer to use Visual Studio Code to create programs, and this occasion was no exception. Visual Studio Code is an easy-to-use interface, making this code easy to write and debug.

I used python for this, seeing as it is the simplest and fastest way to do this simple and fast program.
